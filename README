You need libmikmod 3.1.7 or later installed to use this package:

http://mikmod.darkorb.net/

And thus, a working sound system. Hey, this in in Audio::* !

This package provides the following modules:

 Audio::MikMod - Perl interface to the mikmod API

The following players are included: 

demo/player : 
	Simple non-forking command line interface.
	Usage: ./player <filename>

The Gtk based player was based on code originally in the gtkmikmod package.

demo/player-gtk-fork :
	Perl-GTK based player, uses fork to control the update loop.
	Works fairly well, some buginess with pause/unpause.

demo/player-gtk-ipc :
	Perl-GTK based player, uses IPC::ShareLite to control the
	pause/unpause loop. Still forks update loop.

demo/player-gtk-thread :
	Perl-GTK based player, uses Thread for update loop.
	Works very well, one thread, so no locking.
